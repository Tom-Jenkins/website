### Project Aim
Investigate the population structure and connectivity of European lobster (_Homarus gammarus_) using single nucleotide polymorphisms.

### Description
Individual tissue samples were collected from populations across most of the present-day geographical range of the European lobster (the northeast Atlantic and the Mediterranean). Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were isolated from across the genome of the European lobster using RAD sequencing and were subsequently used to assess population structure and connectivity.
