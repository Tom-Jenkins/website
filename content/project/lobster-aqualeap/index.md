### Project Aim
Determine the molecular mechanisms underpinning growth in the European lobster (_Homarus gammarus_).

### Description
The [Lobster Grower](http://www.lobstergrower.co.uk/) project found that lobsters cultured at sea grow at different rates despite being exposed to almost identical environmental conditions. We have taken tissue samples from these animals and are using a combination of whole genome sequencing, RAD sequencing and methylation sequencing to explore the role of genetic and epigenetic variation in growth.
