### Project Aim
Investigate the population structure of maerl beds using whole genome genotyping.

### Description
Samples of _Phymatolithon calcareum_ from maerl beds across the northeast Atlantic have been collected or provided by collaborators and a whole genome genotyping approach is being conducted to explore population genomics for the first time in this species.

This study has been funded by a British Ecological Society Small Research Grant.

### Maerl beds
Maerl is the generic name for coralline red algae that live unattached on the seafloor. Maerl often aggregate to form extensive maerl beds, a complex 3D biogenic habitat, which provide vital shelter and resources for many marine invertebrates, juvenile fish and other seaweeds. Below are a few examples of the animals and algae they support:
