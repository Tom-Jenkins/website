### Project Aim
Investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of maerl beds using whole genome genotyping.

### Description
Samples of _Phymatolithon calcareum_ were collected from maerl beds across the north-east Atlantic and whole genomes were sequenced to explore population genomics for the first time in a maerl-forming species.

### Maerl Beds
Maerl is the generic name for coralline red algae that live unattached on the seafloor. Maerl often aggregate to form extensive maerl beds, a complex 3D biogenic habitat, which provides vital shelter and resources for many marine invertebrates, juvenile fish and other seaweeds. Below are a just few images of the biodiversity they support:
