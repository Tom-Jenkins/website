### Project Aim
Investigate marine connectivity and population genetics in the pink sea fan.

### Description
Samples of the pink sea fan (_Eunicella verrucosa_) have been collected from populations across the northwest Atlantic and western Mediterranean. Microsatellite markers have previously been developed and used to assess population structure and connectivity in this species [(Holland et al. 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/hdy.2017.14). In this study, we found that populations of pink sea fans from southern Portugal, Britain/France, and northwest Ireland were genetically differentiated, possibly because of reduced connectivity between these areas. Currently, [Kirsty Macleod](http://projects.exeter.ac.uk/meeg/kirsty-macleod) is using mesocosm experiments and genomics to study larval dispersal, population structure and connectivity, and how these processes may be affected by fluctuations in sea temperatures induced by global climate change.
