I am a research scientist and analyst with a broad range of interests in marine biology, genetics, programming and data science. 

I currently work for Natural England as a data analyst where I mainly do geocomputation, data visualisation and statistics. Prior to this, I worked as a research scientist for the University of Exeter where I studied the genetics and biology of marine invertebrates and algae using DNA sequencing data and bioinformatics.
