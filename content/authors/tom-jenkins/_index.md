I am a marine biologist and geneticist with a broad range of interests in marine ecology, environmental science and evolutionary genetics. I currently work as a postdoctoral research scientist at the University of Exeter (UK), where I am investigating how (epi)genetic variation influences growth in the European lobster.

I am also involved in a number of other international collaborative research projects studying aquatic species, from economically valuable clawed lobsters and scampi, to octocorals and calcifying seaweeds such as maerl which support a variety of life and are vital for marine conservation.
