I am a research scientist and analyst with a broad range of interests in marine biology, genomics, programming and data science. 

I currently work for the Animal and Plant Health Agency as a bioinformatician and software developer where I support the Central Unit for Sequencing and PCR in the Surveillance and Laboratory Services Department. Prior to this, I worked in the academic sector as a research scientist in population genomics, marine connectivity and whole genome sequencing, and for Natural England as an advisor for nature recovery and a data analyst in geocomputation, statistics and data visualisation.
