I am a research scientist with a broad range of interests in marine ecology, environmental science and conservation genetics. 

Update: On 1st Feb 2021 I started a new job at Natural England.

Previously, I worked as a postdoctoral research scientist at the University of Exeter where I investigated how genetic and epigenetic variation influences growth in the European lobster. I am also involved in a number of other international collaborative research projects studying marine species, from economically valuable clawed lobsters, to octocorals and calcifying seaweeds such as maerl which support a variety of life and are vital for marine conservation.
