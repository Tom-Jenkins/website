<h3>1. Why bother with R?</h3>
<p>There are so many programs and software out there for analysing population genetic data and generating summary statistics. At first I was quite overwhelmed and unsure which path to take. Then I started learning and using R and I have not looked back since. Aside from the fact that R was the first programming language I learnt, there are several reasons why I like to use R for popgen analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>A wealth of online help resources and tutorials</li>
<li>Analyses easily replicated on new data sets<br />
</li>
<li>Many options for creating publication quality figures and visualisations<br />
</li>
<li>Code can be uploaded to online repositories for other people to reproduce your analysis<br />
</li>
<li>Cross platform compatibility</li>
<li>Free!</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays, popgen R has dozens of packages that often allow you to do similar things but different packages can have their own formatting requirements and R objects. I recommend choosing one type of R object to conduct all your analyses with because converting between R objects can be difficult and frustrating (I work with <code>genind</code> objects from the <code>adegenet</code> package).</p>
<p>In this post, I cover some ‘bread-and-butter’ analyses for typical popgen data sets and highlight some of the R packages and functions I use to analyse such data using example data sets from published studies.</p>
<p><strong>Assumptions</strong><br />
This post assumes that you have installed R and RStudio and that you have some skills in R coding and functionality. To follow along, I recommend that you download the example data sets to a directory of your choice, create a new R script in the same directory and then set your working directory to the location of these files. To set your working directory in RStudio, for example, click Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; To Source File Location.</p>
